# slideshow-css
An animated slideshow only with css

It's based on a bulleted list, improved by css (flexbox and animation attributes).

The purpose of this effect is to show a simple choice menu in a personnal website, 
so you can easily add or remove pictures to add or remove path in your menus. 

When you go over a picture you have a description popping from underneath where you can put a description and a url link to follow.

Feel free to use it, and if you find things to improve I will be pleased to read you and improve my knowledge and work !
